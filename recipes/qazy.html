        <p> Qazi is hard to find in many places, as horse meat is usually consumed mostly by Central Asian countries. </p>
        <p>In Qazaq cuisine there are several dishes made of "qazi" and the most famous among </p>
        <p>them are "Qazi palov" and "Norin". Lately I will post the recipes of these dishes. For </p>

        <p>Put "Qazi" in cold water. Bring water to boil, but just before the boiling point, punch </p>
        <p>"qazi" all over with a thick needle (punching with needle will prevent "qazi" from cracking </p>
        <p>and tearing) below shown the stage when you have to pinch your "qazi": </p>
