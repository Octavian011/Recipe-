        <h2 id="image label"> There are a lot of ways cooking beshbarmak, I'll show you the finest one:</h2>
        <p> Beshbarmak can be prepared in a number of ways depending on the type of meat one would like to </p>
        <p>include in the dish. The most traditional form of the meal is cooked using horse meat, although beef </p>
        <p>and lamb are common substitutions. Pork and chicken are not recommended. For those looking to </p>
        <p>go truly authentic, horse meat sausage called “казы” (kazy) is cooked along with the other cuts.</p>
        <p>However one chooses to prepare beshbarmak, the most important thing to keep in mind is to make a </p>
        <p>lot and invite friends and family with whom to feast. Never fear making too much, either. The largest </p>
        <p>serving of beshbarmak, prepared in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan in 2018, weighed in at just over 3,200 lbs. – </p>
        <p>and all of it was eaten!</p>
